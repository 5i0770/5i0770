### Hi there, I'm SimonðŸ‘‹

I'm a student of computer engineering that enjoys developing robots and autonomous systems. Lately, my focus is on the
fascinating topic of reinforcement learning.   
I'm also passionate about sharing my knowledge with interested people.  
So feel free to browse my repositories and [contact me](simon.otto@stud.uni-heidelberg.de)!
